## Scope Creep – Messy & Powerful

If you’ve ever led a project—whether it’s building a mobile app or launching a new product line—you’ve likely run into **scope creep**. The biggest nightmare for any project manager. 
Though a lot of project managers struggle because of it, a real headache if unmanaged. However, it can also be an unexpected source of innovation. All we need to do is read between the lines and when approached with the right mindset it can lead to something new or different. It can also be an indicator of correcting your course at early stages and help in preventing a total disaster.

### But what exactly is a Scope Creep? 

In one of my earlier projects—a relatively simple marketing dashboard—the goal was straightforward: deliver basic KPIs, a few visualizations, and a clean interface. But as development progressed, the requests kept rolling in:
- “Can we make it real-time?”
- “Can we pull in customer sentiment?”
- “What about predictive analytics?”

Each new idea started pushing the original boundaries. Suddenly, it appeared that we are on the path of  building a data science platform instead of a dashboard. That’s **classic scope creep**. And it's logical to ask, how do we end up in this state when we know what we were getting into or what we wanted? Some of the **common causes** that I have seen in the wild are:

- **Vague Project Scope:** When the initial requirements are not well defined, almost anything can seem like it belongs in the project.
- **Evolving Client Needs:** Stakeholders often realize what they really want only  after seeing early versions of the product.
- **Desire to Please:** Teams—especially junior ones—often say “yes” to keep stakeholders happy without assessing feasibility.
- **Lack of Change Control:** No structured way to evaluate or approve new requests means anything goes.
- **Missing Documentation:** If you’re not capturing and updating requirements, it’s easy to lose sight of what was agreed upon.
- **Miscommunication:** Between teams, departments, or with the client—assumptions multiply and the scope expands without anyone noticing.
- **Limited Subject Matter Understanding:** It's not the stakeholders responsibility to develop subject matter understanding but for a competent project manager to understand and convey the challenges in a simple manner.
- **Too many stakeholders:** Classic case of “Too many cooks spoil the broth.”. It's important to limit the team and number of people who have a major influence on your project. (not considering users for this reason)

### So, How to manage scope creep efficiently? 

Apart from what I found in the books and various blogs. There are few things I carried in from my experience while working on Six-Sigma projects and other process improvement techniques.

1. **Don't rush to finalize the project charter:** Take your time, during the project charter phase we build our team, validate the budget, resources, capabilities etc. However, the most important aspect that helps is to Listen carefully. Try to validate if the Voice of Customer is aligned with the needs of the customer. If you are not certain, have a discussion and validate with the project team and stakeholders.
2. **Define Scope Clearly, Early:** Kindly make it a point to co-create the scope with stakeholders. This isn’t just documentation—it’s alignment. We define:
    - What’s in/out of scope
    - Clear deliverables
    - Success metrics
    - Timelines
    
    A visual scope map + MoSCoW prioritization (Must have / Should have / Could have / Won’t have). Is very helpful and recommended. This can help evaluate the team capabilities, need for expansion or hiring new members, timelines etc. and helps set expectations correctly.
3. **The idea reserve:** Not all ideas can be incorporated straight away or “right now”. Including the good ones and at times to maintain the flow and progress these good ideas need to be held back but kept in a special reserve, which can be looked into later and regularly. This is particularly valuable post-MVP and can be a great source of customer experience or innovation.
4. **Keep emotions away, implement a change request process:** Not easy to implement but saves a lot of hassle and leads to documentation. Implement simple steps to validate things like: 
    - Who’s requesting it?
    - Why is it needed now?
    - What’s the trade-off?
    - What’s the cost/time/resource impact?
    
    Ticketing Tools & Project Management Tools like Jira, Monday etc. are an asset and help track progress and reasons for various activities or delays. They are of great assistance in maintaining transparency and documentations as well.
5. **Track the number of requests and repeated requests specially:** This is one of the most overlooked aspects that I have seen over the years. This can be one of the earlier indicators of delays and failures of your project. If there are repeated out of scope requests, similar kinds from multiple stakeholders. It’s a straight up “Red Flag”. This calls for Immediate reassessment of the project before more resources are invested. “Better to make a stop loss than to lose full business.” 
6. **Communicate the impact Clearly and Transparently:** the most important aspect for sure in any project manager's life. Convey the impact of scope creep and project adjustment transparently. Each request has an impact on timelines, availability of resources and other ongoing projects. Need to keep everyone informed timely. One project’s success cannot come at the cost of another project's failure.  
7. **Your team is the Best Solution:** Spotting a project creep is not only the project manager’s responsibility. Our team members should also be able to spot the challenges each request brings and should be trained to spot the impact and direction of the request they work on. Frequent check ins and ticket evaluation in projects serve a great tool in controlling the projects in this regard.

### Turning scope creep into Innovation

Though I still see scope creep as a major challenge for my projects but I have to also declare, some of the most aggressive jumps in my career have been through grabbing opportunities that were seen to be too complex or not aligned with the project. Each, rejected or an idea for later is a data point. Thus, 
- **Integrate a process** for tracking each request. 
- Update them in a project management system/softeare/interface. This is your **Information collections** and tracking system. (So, you can export them for analysis)
- During analysis use additional infromation or derived variables to **classify the requests**. eg Deep dive requests, Cost focused requests, Feature enhancement etc.
- Multiple requests originating because of a **common unsolved challenges** gives you the direction for your next steps or next project.
- Keep it simple and always ask the **5 Whys**? To discover the underlying *causes* and supplement it with **5 How’s** to explore the *solutions*.

**Example for digital product:**  
<br>**Case:** While working on a digital dashboard a lot of requests originated for expected revenue growth. Though we had a graph, each user, especially the division heads wanted to understand their own domain and expected the dashboard to deliver it.  
<br>**Answer:** A data science prediction model capable of providing estimations at cohort level where data can be fed back into a different dashboard. Eliminating redundancy, repeats, user friendly dashboard with ability to deep dive into cohort profitability.

**Example from physical product:**  
<br>**Case:** Clients expected products that helped them control costs of production while maintaining the same quality, which was delivered by our competitor but required an expensive production process. We worked closely to develop a new product with a client but the results kept on disappointing.  
<br>**Answer:** They were not looking for a new product only but rather for a product that could save them costs while maintaining quality. We realised after experimentation that, if we changed the composition of our current product (material) and prolonged the product life. The new product was costly for clients (per unit) but the operational leverage that results achieves more than the expected savings and revenue. An immediate success.

### Summary: 

Scope creep is a messy, powerful signal. If you ignore it, it’ll wreck your project. If you over-accommodate, you’ll drown in features. But if you listen to it, structure it, and use it, it can bring your next big feature or your next market differentiator.
