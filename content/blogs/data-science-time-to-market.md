## The Problem

Retention was dropping post-onboarding. We needed to target segments with the highest CLV potential.

### The Approach

- Built CLV regression model  
- Created segment triggers  
- Integrated with Braze & Tableau

> "We cut churn by 22% in 3 months."

### The Results

- CLV lift: +27%  
- Campaign ROI: +44%
